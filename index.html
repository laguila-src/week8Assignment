    <h1>Mosaic Art</h1>
    <p>
        Mosaic is the art of creating images with an assemblage of small pieces of colored glass, stone, or other materials. The earliest known examples of
        mosaics made of different materials were found at a temple building in Ubaid, Mesopotamia, and are dated to the second half of 3rd millennium BCE.
        They consist of pieces of colored stones, shells and ivory.
