        The most popular subject for mosaics was mythological scenes, such as the triumphs of Neptune, which are frequently found. The Orpheus myth (with animals) and the muses, sometimes with the god Apollo, 
        are also often illustrated. Inspiration could also come from daily life, like hunting (often with dogs), agriculture, fishing, as well as arts and crafts. The four seasons and the sea are also the 
        subject of numerous mosaics.
